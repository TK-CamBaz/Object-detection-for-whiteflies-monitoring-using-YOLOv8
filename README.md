### Set up working environment
Install:  
(1) Anaconda(An IDE for managing packages of python)  
(2) CUDA(A package for GPU computing)  
(3) Pytorch(A framework for Deep learning)  
(4) ultralytics(YOLOV8)  
For (1)~(3), check https://blog.csdn.net/qq_45956730/article/details/126600028 for details, then visit https://docs.ultralytics.com/ for more information about installation.
### Prepare data
(1) Collect images and labels as much as possible(put more efforts on this, the greater amount of data, the better performance of the model). LabelImg(https://github.com/HumanSignal/labelImg) and Roboflow(https://roboflow.com/) are recommendded to do this work.
