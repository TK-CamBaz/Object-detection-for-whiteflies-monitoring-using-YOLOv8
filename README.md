# Object-detection-for-whiteflies-monitoring-using-YOLOV8
## Why
Deep learning is widely applied in various fields and has achieved excellent results, assisting in the advancement of academia and industry. In agriculture, the cultivation management of crops directly affects the quality of fruits and vegetables, with pest and disease management being a particularly important aspect. Even advanced agricultural companies are troubled by pest and disease infestation. Therefore, it's urgent to introduce artificial intelligence to enhance monitoring efficiency, achieving the goal of early warning of pest and disease occurrence, reducing the economic losses. Here, a case about whiteflies monitoring using deep learning was studied.
## How
In this case, YOLOV8[1], as a SOTA algorithm was selected to conduct object detection. All images of whiteflies on yellow sticky traps were collected using the smartphone by the author[2]. The details were described below:
### Set up working environment
Install: Anaconda(A platform for managing python) --> CUDA(A package for GPU computing) --> Pytorch(A framework for Deep learning)
