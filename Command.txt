# Due to poor GPU of my laptop, I use colab to train my models.
# Don't forget to upload data to google drive.

## Install necessary modules
!pip install ultralytics --upgrade
from ultralytics import YOLO, checks, hub


## Connect colab and google drive 
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive') 

## Check GPU and torch is available or not
import torch
torch.cuda.is_available() 
torch.cuda.get_device_name()

## Model training
# change the paths according to the location of the .yaml files, pre-trained weights and output path.
model = YOLO("/content/drive/MyDrive/ColabNotebooks/DatasetV3/model/yolov8x-ghost.yaml").load("/content/drive/MyDrive/ColabNotebooks/YOLOV8/train2/weights/best.pt")
results = model.train(data="/content/drive/MyDrive/ColabNotebooks/DatasetV9/whitefly.drive.yaml",

## Prediction
